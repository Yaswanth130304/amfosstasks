## Why must we choose you?
 - When I look into the tasks of amFoss i came to understood that this club requires it's member's to have atleast basic knowledge about each and everything as far as possible and the one who always keen to learn new things and improve himself.
 - Luckily I'm very enthusiastic and energitic person who likes to learn more and more about new things as possible as i can each and everyday and change myself for the better version of myself.
 - I'm very research oriented and logistic person. 
 - And can co-ordinate with anyone easily.
 - While doing the amFoss tasks I'd really enjyed it. 
 - Up until now i'm in part of AI-Club member. There I got a chance a to participate in a hackathon which helped me to learn way more new things and how to co-ordinate with other members of the team. It was my first hackaton but there I lead a team of 4 members including me. We did a project on food recipe using api's and all. Even if my team didn't win the hackathon it was a great experirnce.
 - It was a great team to be honest we came across many hurdles and errors while coding for that website
 - But through team work we did finished the project in time.
 - As I said before I'd like to learn more and more and I think amFoss club will be a great place for me to learn. And so I'd like to be a part of amFoss club.
 
## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
- In the next six months, my goal is to continue developing my skills and gaining experience in my field. To do this, I plan to take a few online courses to enhance my knowledge in areas that will be beneficial for my career. I also hope to take on additional responsibilities at work and seek out opportunities to collaborate with colleagues on projects. These actions will not only help me to grow professionally in the short term, but also contribute to my long-term goal of becoming a leader in my industry

## How would you contribute back to the club?
- I believe that I would be able to contribute to the success of the club in a number of ways. First, my skills in programm reasoning and problem-solving would allow me to help the club and identify opportunities for improvement.  Additionally, I am a strong team player and believe in the importance of collaboration and open communication. I am committed to working closely with my colleagues and helping the club achieve its goals.

## Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
- I appreciate the opportunity to participate in the selection process and have overall had a positive experience. One area where I think the process could be improved is in terms of communication. For example, it would have been helpful to have a clearer understanding of the timeline for the selection process and to receive more frequent updates on the status of my application. However, I understand that the selection process is complex and appreciate the efforts that the club has made to ensure a fair and thorough process. Thank you for considering my feedback.
