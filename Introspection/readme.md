1. - When look into the tasks of amFoss i came to understood that this club requires it's member's to have atleast basic knowledge about each and everything as far as possible and the one who always keen to learn new things and improve himself.
2. - Luckily I'm very enthusiastic and energitic person who likes to learn more and more about new things as possible as i can each and everyday and change myself for the better version of myself.
3. - I'm very research oriented and logistic person. 
4. - And can co-ordinate with anyone easily.
5. - Up until now i'm in part of AI-Club member. There I got a chance a to participate in a hackathon which helped me to learn way more new things and how to co-ordinate with other members of the team. It was my first hackaton but there I lead a team of 4 members including me. We did a project on food recipe using api's and all. Even if my team didn't win the hackathon it was a great experirnce.
6. - It was a great team to be honest we came across many hurdles and errors while coding for that website
7. - But through team work we did finished the project in time.
8. - As I said before I'd like to learn more and more and I think amFoss club will be a great place for me to learn. And so I'd like to be a part of amFoss club.
