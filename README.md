## The About
Hello! I'm Yaswanth.R from CSE-C currently in sem-3, I'm from AP but I can speak English, Hindi. So, comming to the point I already applied for amfoss in sem-1 but due to some issues i had to drop at that time but now those issues havebeen solved and I wish to join in the club to explore more. Now i've completed 8tasks. I really enjoyed time while doing these tasks.
